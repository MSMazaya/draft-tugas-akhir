  ABSTRACT = {The security and reliability of data transmission between IoT
              devices are considered to be major challenges in the development of
              IoT technology. This paper presents a low-power, low-cost RISC-V
              processor for IoT applications with an integrated hybrid encryption
              accelerator, which can achieve efficient and secure encryption and
              decryption of data transmitted between IoT devices. The hybrid
              encryption accelerator, which uses the SM3 and the SM4,
              respectively, as hash and symmetric encryption algorithms, achieves
              a balance between encryption security, high speed, and
              key-management convenience. Both the processor and encryption
              accelerator are designed using the Verilog HDL language and are
              subsequently implemented and evaluated on both FPGA and ASIC
              platforms. The performance of the proposed processor and that of
              the Hummingbird E203 and the XuanTie E902 are compared. It is shown
              that, on the FPGA platform, the total resource utilization rate is
              reduced by 39.1~66.2\%. In a 90 nm CMOS process, it is shown that
              the power efficiency of the proposed processor is increased by 10~
              34.8\% and the circuit area is reduced by 32.5~57.1\%.},
